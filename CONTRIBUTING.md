# Contributing to Jetsite

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Jetsite! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

## Development Setup

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Jetsite.git
   cd Jetsite
   ```
3. Create a new branch for your feature:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Code Style Guidelines

### Bash Scripting Standards

- Use `#!/usr/bin/env bash` for maximum compatibility
- Enable strict mode with `set -euo pipefail`
- Use meaningful variable names in UPPER_CASE for environment variables
- Add comments for complex logic sections
- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- Quote variables to prevent word splitting: `"$VARIABLE"`

### Documentation Standards

- Keep README.md up to date with any functional changes
- Add inline comments for complex bash operations
- Use emoji in user-facing messages for better UX
- Document all command-line options and environment variables

## Testing

Before submitting a pull request:

1. Test the script with different scenarios:
   - Valid template repositories
   - Invalid template repositories
   - Empty inputs
   - Network connectivity issues

2. Test the fallback mechanism:
   - Try with repositories that don't support templates
   - Verify the fork-and-rename workflow

3. Verify cross-platform compatibility (if applicable)
